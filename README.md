Render engine project I started as a hobby. Written entirely in c++ using OpenGL and freeglut library for handling low-end graphics operations, ImGui for user interfaces and windows api for keyboard controls. 

This project started as an exercise in getting better at c++ and computer graphics, and does not use the most efficient methods and in a lot of cases, it reinvents the wheel by rewriting functions that already exist in other libraries for graphics api.
